## Books I read

- [Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18106139-programming-ruby-1-9-2-0). My first book on Ruby, found it very valuable. For sure recommend it as your first book to learn about Ruby, good example, easy to read.
- [Pragmatic Scala: Create Expressive, Concise, and Scalable Applications](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25509140-pragmatic-scala). Good introduction, gives you good overall knowledge of the language, after this book could write some solid Scala code.
- [Metaprogramming Ruby 2: Program Like the Ruby Pros](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21824181-metaprogramming-ruby-2). Second book about Ruby. For sure recommend to learn more about it, best practices, hardcore examples. Mostly will be suitable for authors of frameworks.
- [Text Processing with Ruby: Extract Value from the Data That Surrounds You](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27038298-text-processing-with-ruby). Have not seen any value in this book after reading two books from above. Just basic ideas about how to process text.
- [Build Awesome Command-Line Applications in Ruby: Control Your Computer, Simplify Your Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12962826-build-awesome-command-line-applications-in-ruby). Same, have not seen any values. Just basic ideas how to write good CLI tools and how to do that in Ruby.
- [Working with Ruby Threads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17826435-working-with-ruby-threads). Just a refresh from what you have learned from System Programming course and some examples of how to work with Threads in Ruby.
- [A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms: Level Up Your Core Programming Skills](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34695800-a-common-sense-guide-to-data-structures-and-algorithms). To simple, to basic.
- [Take My Money: Accepting Payments on the Web](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34484631-take-my-money). Read it just only because of curiosity. 
- [Ruby Performance Optimization: Why Ruby Is Slow, and How to Fix It](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25276703-ruby-performance-optimization). Expected much more from this book. Good set of tools, but wanted to learn more about anything specific for Ruby.
