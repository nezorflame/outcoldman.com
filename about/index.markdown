Starting from 2005 I participated in designing various kind of projects. I worked
in different companies and on different areas. I worked on building enterprise
applications, applications for engineers, tools for developers, applications for
regular users and solutions for big companies. I worked on mobile, desktop, web
applications and distributed systems. I had experience in building software for
Windows, Linux, OS X and Solaris. I used Visual Studio, Xcode, IDEA,
Sublime Text and Vim for development. I am not a fan of anything, I just like
to code. Every day I'm enjoying to be a software developer.

You may think that I am real nerd and geek. Yes I am. But this does not stop
me from enjoying [active and interesting life](https://instagram.com/outcoldman/).
