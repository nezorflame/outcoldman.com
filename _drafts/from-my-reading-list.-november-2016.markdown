1. [Docker in Production. A History of Failure](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12872304). Definetely an interesting read. Author described some issues he had in past. I would say that it is pretty easy to collect similar set of issues for any technology on the market. But this is just my thought. Commentaries on HackerNews are also must read.
