- [Docker in Production. A History of Failure](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12872304). Definetely an interesting read. Author described some issues he had in past. I would say that it is pretty easy to collect similar set of issues for any technology on the market. But this is just my thought. Commentaries on HackerNews are also must read.
- [Operating System Concepts, 9th
  Edition](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP002013.html).
  Best book you can get about operating system concepts. I believe my
  university did not give me really good deep knowledge on this topic, so this
  book helped me to cover some missing parts.
