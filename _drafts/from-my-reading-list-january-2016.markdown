- [The Open Guide to Equity
    Compensation](https://github.com/jlevy/og-equity-compensation). Right in
    time before filing taxes for 2015.
- [How to C in 2016](https://matt.sh/howto-c). Good refreshing article.
- [Aerial Apple TV screen saver for Windows](https://github.com/cDima/Aerial/).
    Apple TV gen 4 has nice looking screen savers. With this tool you can
    install them on your Mac. You can find also link to Windows version.
- [Monit - Barking at daemons](https://mmonit.com/monit/). Not sure I
    understand why would you use this service. In production you will probably
    use more advanced monitoring tools, for auto-restarts you will use standard
    daemon services. But still interesting realization.
