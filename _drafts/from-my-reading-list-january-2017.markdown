- [Be Careful with Python's New-Style String Format](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2016/12/29/careful-with-str-format/).
- [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com). Very simple and good manual for how to write your own interpreter, including how to parse, build AST and evaluate it with some simple REPL. `Go` is secondary in this language, you can think about it as a some pseudo language, the important part of this book is the step-by-step guide, not the `Go`.
- [How we got 1 in 6 Microsoft employees to join our anonymous app.](https://hackernoon.com/how-we-got-1-in-6-microsoft-employees-to-join-our-anonymous-app-74ff6916bebd). Interesting point about how luck helps to build your startup.
