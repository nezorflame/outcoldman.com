- [Be Careful with Python's New-Style String Format](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2016/12/29/careful-with-str-format/).
- [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com). Very simple and good manual for how to write your own interpreter, including how to parse, build AST and evaluate it with some simple REPL. `Go` is secondary in this language, you can think about it as a some pseudo language, the important part of this book is the step-by-step guide, not the `Go`.
- [Building a Compiler in Swift with LLVM, Part 1: Introduction and the Lexer](https://harlanhaskins.com/2017/01/08/building-a-compiler-with-swift-in-llvm-part-1-introduction-and-the-lexer.html). Similar to previous topic, but less informative and in Swift. This is first part of coming blog post series.
- [A Tourist’s Guide to the LLVM Source Code](http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1453). This link also will get you to the [LLVM Tutorial: Table of Contents](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/index.html), which teaches you how to write your own language with LLVM.

- [The Inside Story of BitTorrent’s Bizarre Collapse](https://backchannel.com/the-inside-story-of-bittorrents-bizarre-collapse-a0766a5442d7). Quote "Perhaps the lesson here is that sometimes technologies are not products. And they’re not companies. They’re just damn good technologies."
- [why-rethinkdb-failed.md](https://github.com/coffeemug/defstartup/blob/master/_drafts/why-rethinkdb-failed.md). Sad story *the open-source developer tools market is one of the worst markets one could possibly end up in*.
