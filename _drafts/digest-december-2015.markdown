- [tig](http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/). "Tig is an ncurses-based text-mode interface for git."
    Just install it and you will see. After you will install it you will never
    need any Git interfaces, just command line and `tig`.
- [ncdu](http://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu). "Ncdu is a disk usage analyzer with an ncurses interface."
    There are plenty tools in App Store on OSX which allows you to track what is
    taking so much space on your disk. But `ncdu` is free, works in terminal
    and better than others.
