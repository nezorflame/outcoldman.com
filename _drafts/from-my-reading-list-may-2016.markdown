- [VimGenius](http://www.vimgenius.com). This is probably the best how to get
  started with Vim tutorial. Very easy, but nothing interesting for experienced
  Vim users.
- [Stack Overflow: How We Do Deployment - 2016
  Edition](http://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/05/03/stack-overflow-how-we-do-deployment-2016-edition/).
  Interesting article from one of the employees in StackOverflow how they
  perform deployment. Also take a look on commentaries on [Hacker
  News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11620890) as there are some
  StackOverflow employees also answer on questions.
