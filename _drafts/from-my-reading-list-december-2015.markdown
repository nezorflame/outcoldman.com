- [Provenance](https://github.com/jasarien/Provenance) - great NES emulator for
    Apple TV 4th gen and iOS. I also bought [SteelSeries Nimbus Wireless Gaming
    Controller](https://steelseries.com/gaming-controllers/nimbus) for it. Love
    NES games.
- [Dec 8: How to stop a DDoS attack](https://blog.fastmail.com//2015/12/08/how-to-stop-a-ddos-attack/).
    FastMail was under DDoS attack (again), this time they published very
    detailed explanation how they prevent DDoS attack.
- [Choosing an HTTP Status Code â€” Stop Making It Hard](http://racksburg.com/choosing-an-http-status-code/).
    It is always hard to find right HTTP Status Code when you are developing
    REST API. This guide / diagrams should help you with that.
- [Uninstalling packages (.pkg files) on Mac OS
    X](https://wincent.com/wiki/Uninstalling_packages_(.pkg_files)_on_Mac_OS_X).
    The good thing about Windows that it provides a way to uninstall any *msi*
    installed on the system. Uninstalling application on OS X is not so easy
    (see official guide [OS X Yosemite: Install, update, and uninstall
    apps](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18752?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US)).
    But still possible find all installed packages using *pkgutil* tool. You
    can also take a look on discussion on *superuser* [How do I uninstall any
    Apple pkg Package
    file?](http://superuser.com/questions/36567/how-do-i-uninstall-any-apple-pkg-package-file/)
    to find some apps/wrappers on top of *pkgutil*.
