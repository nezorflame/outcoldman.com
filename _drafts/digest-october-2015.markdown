- [lnav](http://lnav.org). "An advanced log file viewer for the small-scale".
    It is a great replacement for `tail -f`, `less` and anything else you use
    for analyzing logs. Very fast, very intuitive, well integrated with terminal.
- [ranger](http://ranger.nongnu.org). "ranger is a console file manager with VI key bindings."
    Great tool, but to be honest I do not use it very often, but still keep it
    installed.
