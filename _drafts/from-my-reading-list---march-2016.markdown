- [curl vs Wget](https://daniel.haxx.se/docs/curl-vs-wget.html). From the
    author of `curl` page describes the differences between curl and wget.
- [The VimL Primer](https://pragprog.com/book/bkviml/the-viml-primer). I have
    bought this book a while ago, but did not have a time to read it. One thing
    which I missed when I purchased it was the `L` in `VimL`. I thought this is
    just another book about the `Vim`. But it is actually a book about the
    `Vim` language. Very short book, good to just get some basic knowledge,
    which may help you to debug Vim plugins.
- [Awesome-Selfhosted](https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted). This is
    a list of Free Software network services and web applications which can be
    hosted locally. Selfhosting is the process of locally hosting and managing
    applications instead of renting from SaaS providers.
