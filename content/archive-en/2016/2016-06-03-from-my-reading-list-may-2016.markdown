- [VimGenius](http://www.vimgenius.com). This is probably the best how to get
  started with Vim tutorial. Very easy, but nothing interesting for experienced
  Vim users.
- [Stack Overflow: How We Do Deployment - 2016
  Edition](http://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/05/03/stack-overflow-how-we-do-deployment-2016-edition/).
  Interesting article from one of the employees in StackOverflow how they
  perform deployment. Also take a look on commentaries on [Hacker
  News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11620890) as there are some
  StackOverflow employees also answer on questions.
- [Librevault - File synchronization designed with privacy in mind](https://librevault.com).
  Open source, written in C/C++. Good replacement for syncthing and DropBox.
- [Turtl](https://turtl.it). Open Source replacement for Evernote.
- [Linux Journey - Learn the ways of Linux-fu, for free.](https://linuxjourney.com).
  Very nice basic learning pages for Linux.
- [Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville - Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org). MIT Press book.
- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com). Another
  free book about Deep Learning.
- [Deep Language Modeling for Question Answering using Keras](http://benjaminbolte.com/blog/2016/keras-language-modeling.html).
  This post provides an in-depth introduction to using Keras for deep language modeling.
- [Logitech MX Master](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-master). Bought a mouse,
  highly recommend. I was a really big fun of [Logitech V550 Nano](http://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/v550-nano-cordless-laser-mouse-for-notebooks). But Logitech don't make them anymore.
  MX Master allows you to connect mouse up to 3 PC/Macs.
- [Vagga](https://github.com/tailhook/vagga). Vagga is a fully-userspace container engine
  inspired by Vagrant and Docker, specialized for development environments.
- [libui](https://github.com/andlabs/libui). Simple and portable (but not inflexible)
  GUI library in C that uses the native GUI technologies of each platform it supports.
- [Nix as OS X Package Manager](http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2016/05/nix-as-os-x-package-manager.html).
  Personally I see 0 reasons to move from Homebrew, but it is good that we have
  alternatives.

Out of curiosity have read few blogs/articles about how people actually build text editors.
