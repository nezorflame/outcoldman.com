- [PlatformIO is an open source ecosystem for IoT
    development](http://platformio.org). I still playing with the Arduino and
    Raspberry Pi. A lot of fun stuff you can do with them. If you want to
    develop Arduino projects you should check this link. It is a missed package
    management for Arduino, plus a way to develop Arduino projects in
    [Vim](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/vim.html). You
    can also install `PlatformIO` on Raspberry Pi and develop Arduino projects
    on it. I checked - it works. I have not tried this one, but you can also
    use [Standard C++](http://platformio.org/#!/lib/show/572/StandardCplusplus)
    with Arduino.
- [How to unlock a Mac that's been locked with Apple Remote Desktop's “curtain”
    screen
    lock](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/65149/how-to-unlock-a-mac-thats-been-locked-with-apple-remote-desktops-curtain-scr).
    I do not use it very often, but sometimes I do use VNC for connecting to
    remote Mac machine. It happened to me more than once, that after your VNC
    session will die you will find black screen on your Mac's display. In one
    of the answers you will find `sunshine-ard` utility which can unblock your
    Mac, if you will be able to SSH onto it.
- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](http://dataintensive.net). On the
    half way of this book. Everything you want to know about NoSQL, Big Data,
    Scalability, CAP Theorem, Eventual Consistency, Sharding. And if something
    is not covered in this book - it has a lot of links for additional
    material.
- [GNU Make Book](https://www.nostarch.com/gnumake). Reading this one as well
    to get to know make a little better.
