- [lnav](http://lnav.org). "An advanced log file viewer for the small-scale".
    It is a great replacement for `tail -f`, `less` and anything else you use
    for analyzing logs. Very fast, very intuitive, well integrated with terminal.
- [ranger](http://ranger.nongnu.org). "ranger is a console file manager with VI key bindings."
    Great tool, but to be honest I do not use it very often, but still keep it
    installed.
- [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md).
    I have not read it, but kept it in my archive. Good article you may want to
    give interns or CPP beginners. Feels like a combination of [Code Complete](http://cc2e.com)
    and [Scott Meyers Books](http://www.aristeia.com/books.html).
- [Introduction to parallel & distributed algorithms](http://www.toves.org/books/distalg/).
    Again, going to my archive. Don't think that there are anything new, but for
    some reason it appeared in my list, maybe somebody suggested it. Will keep
    it in archive, maybe one day will use it to refresh the knowledge.
- [Linux Inside by 0xAX](https://www.gitbook.com/book/0xax/linux-insides/details).
    If you want to get some advanced knowledge about Linux knowledge - this is a
    guide. This book requires a lot of time to understand it. I have not read the
    whole book, just few parts.
- [DuckDuckHuck / How Can I Contribute?](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/contributing).
    If you have not tried it, just take a look one more time on [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com).
    Great search engine. You can turn it on by default in Safari (iOS and OS X).
    As you can see this Search Engine also allows you to contribute, add your
    own cheatsheets, like [this one](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=cheatsheet+tmux&ia=cheatsheet&iax=1).
    And the most important it allows you to use [bang commands](https://duckduckgo.com/bang),
    like `!w` for Wikipedia or `!a` for Amazon, and even `!g` for Google.
    I have been using it for the last month and so far it replaces Google very well.
- [Rick and Morty](http://www.adultswim.com/videos/rick-and-morty/). If you need 
    to have something to kill the time, this is a great TV Show. I saw that somebody
    mentioned Second season of it, so I watched the Pilot and hooked up. Not for kids.
    Kind of IT/Science related.
